# Fighting + Auto battler + Card picking
Players has 1-2-3 characters, each turn player picks skills/items/body parts/upgrade as card. Maybe 3 of the same type will upgrade. They player can put the uprade into he character.

Each run the character will battle each other. Maybe the player can change order of characters.

It would be nice to have the characters automatically fights, and have some physic-based interaction.
