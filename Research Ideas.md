## Compartment policies
- [[@clements2018aces]] introduce an algorithm that determine the compartments based on the data dependencies. To reduce the number of partitions, an ad-hoc merging strategy is used, where you could either merge data nodes or function nodes. Is there a sound & quantitative way to compartment programs?
