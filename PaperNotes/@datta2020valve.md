- The paper point out a problem with [[Serverless Computing]] is that the developer does not have total control in where data is flowing.
- Existing works does not consider the interaction between functions?
- The proposed system enable [[Dynamic Information Flow Tracking]] in distributed serverless applications. Through DIFT, the system can enforce and audit dataflow across the *workflow*.
