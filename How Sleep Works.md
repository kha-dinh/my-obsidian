The urge to sleep is motivated by two mechanisms, the internal *circadian* clock and the *sleep pressure* caused by adenosine built up in the brain.


The circadian clock is mostly constant. It governs body temperature, alertness, ...
The circadian clock is not perfectly 24-hour.  Seeing sunlight helps adjust the clock. 

Adenosine keeps building while you stay awake, and is flushed when you sleep.
[[Caffeine]] blocks the adenosine receptors in the brain.


The two mechanisms work *independently*. This is why you feels alert in the morning even after an all-nighter.
