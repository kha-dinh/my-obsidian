# Introduction
Over the years, researchers have retrofit or find novel use of existing mechanisms for software compartmentalization. For instance, LOTRx86 retrofit the unused ring 2 to protect sensitive operations from untrusted components. Shred use ARM memory domain.


We observe that the ARM's newly introduce security primitives provides opportunities for compartmentalization.

We define a compartment as combination of code

ARM MTE allows the coloring of memory such that it can only be accessed by pointers that have the same tag. To enforce compartmentalization with such primitive, we observe that:
1. Pointers generated by the compartment have the same tag
2. To enforce such scheme, we must strictly prevent the corruption of pointers. To this end, data pointer integrity satisfy such requirement.

MTE-based compartmentalization allows the efficient zero-copy data sharing between compartments. A compartment simply pass a tagged pointer from one compartment to another. To prevent a user compartment from abusing such pointer, we track the propagation of shared pointer,
